# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Info

To build the form I used "Formik", because it's very easy to check inputs dans validates data with "Yup".
Every field present in the Form are mandatory, if the field doesn't meet requirement an error message is displayed.
To check the number of Holiday Allowance, I implemented inside onChange.

If the form is valid, I displayed the values of the Form in the console.

I didn't had time to make a lot of test
